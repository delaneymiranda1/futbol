We are setting a technical kick off meeting for Tuesday and a wrap meeting for Sunday. We will meet as needed throughout as well.

A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.
We are going to establish a foundation for the project at tomorrows kick off meeting. From that we will divide up the work so it is possible to work independently and on branches. We are using Github Projects to manage our work flow.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.
We decided to utilize github project and listed all the methods to assign to the owners using snake draft. We made a status dropdown to give everyone to update their status of each method (in progress, done, need review).  

A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.
We decided to put all the methods in one class (stat_tracker) and once we are all done with the methods, we are going to move some of the helper methods to a module and/or different class based on what each methods require.
